# Secure_File_Sharing
This project is a GUI application with secure file sharing that requires a username and password, with passwords securely stored. Users must create a username, password, a private and public key pair during the first registration process. The public key must be published, and the private key must be kept secret. For the user(sender) to send an encrypted file to another user(receiver), the user(sender) should choose the required file and the application generates a random key automatically to use in the encryption process using the AES algorithm. The random key is encrypted by the other user’s(receiver’s) public key using the RSA algorithm and is sent alongside the encrypted file. For the other user(receiver) to decrypt the file, he should choose his private key to decrypt the encrypted random key using the RSA algorithm. Now the random key is ready to be used to decrypt the encrypted file using the AES algorithm.
